Filters methods belong to the category of feature selection methods that select features independently of the machine learning algorithm model. This is one of the biggest advantages of filter methods. Features selected using filter methods can be used as an input to any machine learning models. Another advantage of filter methods is that they are very fast. Filter methods are generally the first step in any feature selection pipeline.
